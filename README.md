Service for a veterinary clinic

The director of the veterinary clinic turned to us and said:
"The clinic needs a microservice for storing and updating information for dogs!"
The director talked to the IT department, and they compiled documentation in the OpenAPI format.

To open it, we need:<br> 
● Download <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qtHEGCl2gpLxOR7CJPOC40tHp4hwYL5_/view">file</a> with its description in YAML format <br> 
● Open [Swagger Editor](https://editor-next.swagger.io)<br> 
● upload the contents of the file to the left side <br> 
Our goal is to implement the described microservice!

important: We use a blank <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14wEjgs97V9im6zHZo3JIwU8rTsus0cI4/view">main.py</a> to work on a task
